# Wood Knot Detection using VGG16

## Project Overview

This project utilizes a VGG16-based deep learning model to automatically detect different types of knots in wood images. The goal is to improve wood processing efficiency by automating knot identification.

## Data

- **Training Data:** The `dataset_full` directory contains images of wood with labeled knot types.
- **Testing Data:** The `data_small` directory contains images for model evaluation.

## Model Architecture

- **Feature Extractor:** Pre-trained VGG16 model.
- **Custom Head:** Dense and Dropout layers for knot classification.
- **Optimizer:** Adam optimizer.
- **Loss Function:** Sparse categorical cross-entropy.
- **Evaluation Metric:** Sparse categorical accuracy.

## Key Features

- Data augmentation for improved model generalizability.
- Visualization of class distribution and training loss/accuracy.
- Confusion matrix analysis for detailed performance evaluation.

## Getting Started

1. Install required libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib).
2. Download and organize the training and testing data.
3. Run the `train.py` script to train the model.
4. Analyze the training results and confusion matrix.

## Further Exploration

- Experiment with hyperparameter tuning for potential performance improvement.
- Address class imbalance in the dataset for better training on minority classes.
- Utilize Grad-CAM for model interpretation and understanding key features.
- Evaluate the model on unseen data for real-world performance assessment.

## Contributions

- Feel free to fork and improve the code.
- Report any issues or suggest enhancements.
